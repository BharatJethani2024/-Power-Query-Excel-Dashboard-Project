# -Power-Query-Excel-Dashboard-Project
ðŸ“Š Power Query &amp; Excel Dashboard Project
Iâ€™m excited to share my latest project, where I combined key learnings from my course with new techniques to create an interactive and insightful dashboard! ðŸš€


ðŸ”¹ Key Achievements:

âœ… Data Import & Transformation: Imported data from a large text file using Power Query and set up a single connection to the master data file.

âœ… Efficient Query Setup: Created 3 separate queries from the master data using referencing queries.

âœ… Dynamic Calendar Table: Built a calendar table with logic to flag the latest and previous month, using conditional columns and M code tweaks.

âœ… Data Modeling: Established relationships between tables using Excelâ€™s Data Model for seamless analysis.

âœ… Advanced Pivot Tables: Extracted key insights using multiple Pivot Tables.

âœ… Interactive Dashboard Elements: Connected Excel shapes & text boxes to cell values for a dynamic experience.

âœ… Visual Emphasis: Applied conditional formatting & icon sets to highlight percentage differences.

âœ… Creative Display Trick: Used the linked picture technique to place conditional formatting results anywhere on the dashboard.

âœ… Enhanced Interactivity: Implemented Pivot Charts & Slicers for better user engagement.

âœ… User-Friendly Design: Restricted the user view to focus solely on the dashboard by hiding unused columns & rows.


This project was a great learning experience in data transformation, visualization, and dashboard design. Looking forward to applying these skills to real-world datasets!
